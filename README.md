App Description

We have decided to create a head to head trivia battling game. Users can join battles based on location, team up and enter matchmaking to find opponents, or challenge a friend. Quizzes are organized into categories such as math, history, geography, geopolitics, etc. Users can also create quizzes and review quizzes made by other users to be added to the game. The app will track a user's ranking and best scores on specific quiz categories. It will include a leader board so you can compare and compete with friends. We hope to create a fun environment for a more immersive and interactive trivia experience.
